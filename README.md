# Aurora

Notes from class 2021-09-30:

- EPR is a good place to start
  - We should start here and work out
- Code and Storm directories are probably not useful
- There is definitely duplicate code (for example, EPR/Library/rays.c and
Utils/rays.c are almost exactly the same)
- We are currently missing some textures, which Genetti will be providing later
